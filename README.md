# pbuilder-aide

pbuilder-aide is a tool designed to simplify the creation, update, and login process for Debian GNU/Linux chroot environments using pbuilder. It streamlines the management of isolated Debian-based development and testing environments.

## Features

- Easy creation and management of chroot environments using pbuilder
- Support for multiple distributions and architectures
- Custom role definition capability
- Support for additional pbuilder options

## Note

- The base.tgz file is created in the current directory.
- The bindmounts directory is created at `$HOME/.pbuilder-aide/`.

## Prerequisites

- `sudo` command
- `pbuilder` command
- sudo privileges

Please ensure that both `sudo` and `pbuilder` are installed and available in your system's PATH. pbuilder-aide will check for these commands at startup and exit with an error message if they are not found.

## Installation

Build the program:

```
$ go build
```

## Usage

pbuilder-aide provides three main commands: `create`, `update`, and `login`. Each command requires the `-d` (distribution) flag, and accepts optional `-a` (architecture) and `-r` (role) flags.

### Creating a chroot environment

```
$ pbuilder-aide create -d sid -a amd64
```

### Updating a chroot environment

```
$ pbuilder-aide update -d bullseye -a arm64
```

### Logging into a chroot environment

```
$ pbuilder-aide login -d sid -a amd64 -- --save-after-login
```

## Options

- `-d, --distribution`: (Required) The distribution to use
- `-a, --architecture`: (Optional, default: amd64) The architecture to use
- `-r, --role`: (Optional) Custom role name
- `--force`: (For create command only) Overwrite existing base.tgz

Additional pbuilder options can be specified after `--`.
